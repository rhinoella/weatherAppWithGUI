# Noella's Weather App
*Made with PyQt5*

I made this project because I wanted to improve my Python skills as well as learn to make GUIs 
using the PyQt5 framework. To make this app, I wanted to follow the Model-View-Controller pattern.
The model stores the data and handles the logic while the View handles the UI. The controller 
connects the two.

The app has a simple interface that lets you input the name of the city you want to get the
weather for, and then it will show you the weather for today, tommorow and the day after tommorow.
It will also show the maximum and minimum temperatures.

The app uses the Nominatim and 7Timer APIs to get the geocodes and weather respectively.

In the future, I want to clean up the UI by changing the colours and maybe including my own graphics.
I also will try to get a more detailed weather report, possibly by the hour instead of an average of 
the whole day.
